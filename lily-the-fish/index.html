        <h1 class="title">Lily the Fish</h1><h1 class="subheading">By Theo Luttrell</h1><p>Lily was a fish who loved to play with her friends. Every day she'd splash around with them.
    Suddenly, one day, she saw something shiny floating in the ocean. She swam towards it to see what it was. It was hard and smooth. It was a plastic bottle! She felt sad and angry at the fact that people would throw plastic into the ocean.
    </p>
    <p>She gathered her friends and asked them to swim around and gather all of the rubbish they could find. They soon filled a big net and left it on the shore for humans to see and get them to fix their mistake.
